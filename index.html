    <h3>"They say an army marches on its stomach and Williams is no exception" - Michael Caines</h3>
    <p>When Michael Caines lost his right arm in a car accident in 1994, the dream of becoming a top-level chef seemed a million miles away.</p>
    <p>Twenty-three years and two Michelin stars later, he hasn't just become one of his industry's most distinguished figures, he's also fueling some of the fastest drivers in the world.</p>
    <p>A partner and ambassador for Formula One team Williams Martini Racing, the 48-year-old hosts the team's sponsors, engineers and drivers on race weekends.</p>
    <p>"I grew up watching Williams dominate in that era of Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill being made World Champions for this great racing team," says Caines, who has built an empire of award-winning, elite restaurants in the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>"You see your heroes on TV and think 'wow!' ... and the next thing you know, you find yourself in the paddock.</p>
